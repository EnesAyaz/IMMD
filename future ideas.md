## New Ideas
* Multilevel rectifier: A fully integrated AC-DC-AC motor drive can be achieved
* Current source inverter: Utilization of machine windings as DC-link inductors.
* Online Winding Reconfiguration: Extend the operating range of the machine.
* Medium Voltage Machine Drive Application: Utilization of series converter.
* Active Magnetic Bearing: It is possible to manipulate the power and flux of any machine
segment. Lower audible noise, lower friction loss and longer lifespan of motor drive system
* Possibility of continuous operation under fault condition.
* Pole number change for a better speed range.
* Online temperature control by applying different set points (switching frequency etc.)
* Detection of machine asymmetry by voltage ripple (individual) etc. This may even lead to predictive maintenance.
* Manipulation of voltage ripples to smooth the torque ripple.
