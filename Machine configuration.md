## Fractional slot concentrated winding (FSCW) PM-BLDC machines

**Fractional Slot Concentrated Windings: A New Method to
Manage the Mutual Inductance between Phases in Three-Phase
Electrical Machines and Multi-Star Electrical Machines**

With concentrated windings, a new degree of freedom appears; the configuration—number of slots/number of poles—can have a positive impact.

FSCW structure involves a lot of magnetic field harmonics in the airgap, which is not the best situation regarding the iron loss mitigation or the production of torque.

They are able to provide machines with short axial length.

The magnetic field harmonics can be reduced by numerous methods. The first one is the use of double layer windings which destroys many harmonics and reduces others. If this is not enough, the second solution is in using q = 0.5 which destroys all the sub-harmonics.


**Guidelines for Designing Concentrated Winding Fractional Slot Permanent Magnet Machines**

The fractional slot PM synchronous machine is inherently best suited for low speed applications.

It is easy to see that the end windings of the fractional slot concentrated windings (q ≤ ½) are notably shorter than the end windings of integral slot windings.

End windings are not overlapping each other.

**Fractional-Slot Concentrated-Windings Synchronous Permanent Magnet Machines: Opportunities and Challenges**

**Advantages** include:
* high power density
* high efficiency, short end turns
* high slot fill factor particularly  when coupled with segmented stator structures
* low cogging torque
* flux-weakening capability
* fault tolerance

One of the key **challenges of using FSCW configurations** is the significant rotor losses (including magnet losses, rotor core losses, and sleeve losses in case of conductive sleeve) particularly at high speeds due to the various sub- and superspace-harmonic components inherent to such winding configurations that are not in synchronism with the rotor.

* Maintains all electrical and mechanical properties of motor
* Can be easily generated from a conventional motor
* Interconnections are eliminated
* Manufacturing is easier
* End winding size, cost and loss is reduced

In the configurations below, the stator has 2 pole pairs and 12 slots

## Split winding coils in identical pole pair (concentrated)
The split winding approach is very flexible when there are more slots per pole per phase (SPP).
All the segments have the same current and voltage ratings, but they are locating at different stator angles.
