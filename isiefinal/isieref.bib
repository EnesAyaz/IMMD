The capacitive loss analysis also helps in determining the optimum number of devices used in parallel for a given power level and switching frequency. The analysis is performed on a 1.7 kW full bridge isolated dc-dc GaN converter at a switching frequency of 50 kHz.

The proposed IMMD topology reduces the segment voltage and offers an opportunity to utilize wide bandgap 200V GaN MOSFETs. Consequently, a reduction in IMMD size is achieved by eliminating inverter heat sink and optimizing the choice of DC-link capacitors. Gate signals of the IMMD segments are shifted (interleaved) to cancel the capacitor voltage ripple and further reduce the capacitor size. Motor winding configuration and coupling effect are also investigated to match with the IMMD design. An actively controlled balancing resistor is programmed to balance the voltages of series connected IMMD segments. Furthermore, this paper presents simulation results as well as experiment results to validate the proposed design.},

The use of these new power semiconductor devices will allow both an important improvement in the performance of existing power converters and the development of new power converters, accounting for an increase in the efficiency of the electric energy transformations and a more rational use of the electric energy. At present, SiC and GaN are the more promising semiconductor materials for these new power devices as a consequence of their outstanding properties, commercial availability of starting material, and maturity of their technological processes.

abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of the input voltage unbalance and sags on the dc-bus electrolytic capacitors in adjustable-speed drives (ASDs) in order to predict their impact on expected capacitor lifetime. The key phenomenon that causes these problems is the transition of the rectifier stage from three-phase to single-phase operation. Since the equivalent series resistance increases at low frequencies, the low-order harmonic current components (e.g., 120 and 240 Hz) contribute disproportionately to the capacitor power losses and temperature rise, resulting in reduced lifetime. Closed-form expressions are developed for predicting these effects including the impact of finite line impedance, finite bus capacitance, and varying load. The impact of inverter space-vector pulsewidth-modulation switching on the capacitor loss is also included. Simulations and experimental tests are used to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the closed-form analysis using a 5-hp ASD system},

Instead of utilizing two adjacent active vectors at each switching period as in classic PWM strategies, this new strategy utilizes two nonadjacent active vectors in the case of low-modulation index or three consecutive active vectors in the case of high-modulation index. Analytical calculations show that this new strategy is particularly effective in terms of reducing filtering capacitor rms current for high-power factor compared to space vector PWM which is used as a reference strategy. The impact of this strategy on output current quality is also investigated.},

abstract = {Gallium–nitride power transistor (GaN HEMT) and integrated circuit technologies have matured dramatically over the last few years, and many hundreds of thousands of devices have been manufactured and fielded in applications ranging from pulsed radars and counter-IED jammers to CATV modules and fourth-generation infrastructure base-stations. GaN HEMT devices, exhibiting high power densities coupled with high breakdown voltages, have opened up the possibilities for highly efficient power amplifiers (PAs) exploiting the principles of waveform engineered designs. This paper summarizes the unique advantages of GaN HEMTs compared to other power transistor technologies, with examples of where such features have been exploited. Since RF power densities of GaN HEMTs are many times higher than other technologies, much attention has also been given to thermal management—examples of both commercial “off-the-shelf” packaging as well as custom heat-sinks are described. The very desirable feature of having accurate large-signal models for both discrete transistors and monolithic microwave integrated circuit foundry are emphasized with a number of circuit design examples. GaN HEMT technology has been a major enabler for both very broadband high-PAs and very high-efficiency designs. This paper describes examples of broadband amplifiers, as well as several of the main areas of high-efficiency amplifier design—notably Class-D, Class-E, Class-F, and Class-J approaches, Doherty PAs, envelope-tracking techniques, and Chireix outphasing.},

This new technology enables the design of converters at higher frequencies and efficiencies than those achievable with conventional Si devices. This paper reviews the characteristics and commercial status of both vertical and lateral GaN power devices, providing the background necessary to understand the significance of these recent developments. Additionally, the challenges encountered in GaN-based converter design are considered, such as the consequences of faster switching on gate driver design and board layout. Other issues include the unique reverse conduction behavior, dynamic Rds,on, breakdown mechanisms, thermal design, device availability, and reliability qualification. This review will help prepare the reader to effectively design GaN-based converters as these devices become increasingly available on a commercial scale.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of motor drive technologies used for safety-critical aerospace applications, with a particular focus placed on the choice of candidate machines and their drive topologies. Aircraft applications demand high reliability, high availability, and high power density while aiming to reduce weight, complexity, fuel consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact. New electric driven systems can meet these requirements and also provide significant technical and economic improvements over conventional mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems. Fault-tolerant motor drives can be achieved by partitioning and redundancy through the use of multichannel three-phase systems or multiple single-phase modules. Analytical methods are adopted to compare caged induction, reluctance, and PM motor technologies and their relative merits. The analysis suggests that the dual (or triple) three-phase PMAC motor drive may be a favored choice for general aerospace applications, striking a balance between necessary redundancy and undue complexity, while maintaining a balanced operation following a failure. The modular single-phase approach offers a good compromise between size and complexity but suffers from high total harmonic distortion of the supply and high torque ripple when faulted. For each specific aircraft application, a parametrical optimization of the suitable motor configuration is needed through a coupled electromagnetic and thermal analysis, and should be verified by finite-element analysis.},

abstract = {Currently, assemblies of power semiconductor switches and their associated drive circuitry are available in modules. MOSFETs and IGBTs are used as switches and these elec- tric gated devices facilitate the incorporation of gate driving functions in the module. These mod- ules are sometimes also provided with limited internal sensing and protection functions. From a few 100 watts downward, one finds silicon monolithic technology as the integration vehicle, while upward into the multi-kilowatt range, mixed mode module construction is used. This incorporates monolithic, hybrid, surface mount and wirebond technology. However, a close examination of the applications in motor drives and power supplies indicates that there has been no dramatic volume reduction of the subsystem. The power semiconductor modules have shrunk the power switching part of the converter, but the bulk of the subsystem volume still comprises the associated control, sensing, electromagnetic power passives (inductors, transformers, capacitors) and interconnect structures. The article addresses the improvement of power processing technology through advanced inte- gration of power electronics. The goal of a subsystem in a module necessitates this advanced inte- gration. The central philosophy of the technology development research in the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Power Electronic Systems is to advance the state of the art by providing the concept of integrated power electronics modules (IPEMs). The technology underpinning such an IPEM approach is discussed. The fundamental functions in electronic power processing, the materials, processes and integration approaches and future concepts are explained. Ample use is made of illustrations, photographs of integrated modules and subsystems to en- hance the value of the article to the non-specialist},

abstract = {A concept of an integrated and distributed inverter for switched reluctance machines is introduced. The application at hand is an outer-rotor direct drive designed for railway traction applications. A five-phase switched reluctance machine was developed and is used to demonstrate the function of the integrated and distributed inverter. The distribution is achieved by supplying each phase coil with its own modular inverter. Each inverter module is placed evenly around the end of the stator stack next to its dedicated coil. This increases the redundancy of the drive significantly. The likelihood of phase-to-phase faults is reduced, because no overlapping end-turns are necessary. Also, the integration of machine and inverter is simplified, because the semiconductors can be evenly distributed around the machine. The concept reduces the amount of terminals between drive and vehicle to communication, power supply, and cooling, independent of the number of machine phases. With the integrated and distributed inverter new control strategies can be developed to influence machine vibration and radiated noise. In this paper, the design of the prototype, the direct torque control of the five-phase machine, and the behavior in the case of a fault inside a module is analyzed.},

abstract = {Pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) ac drives generate high differential-mode (DM) motor voltages due to the reflected wave phenomenon. The common-mode (CM) voltage produced by a PWM inverter also has fast transitions that result in high peak currents to ground. For low-power ac drives, this can present several issues, such as pump-up of the dc bus and failure of the power module due to high instantaneous currents that are often undetected because of the typical sampling algorithm used. In this paper, existing drive output filter solutions are reviewed, and a new filter design is presented, which has integrated DM and CM impedance with damping matched to typical cable surge impedance. This eliminates reflections of both DM and CM traveling waves and also reduces peak cable charging currents. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the new filter has improved performance to reduce motor DM and CM voltages and drive output CM current, thus mitigating the issues specifically seen with low-power ac drives. Complete design details for the filter and a particular implementation of the integrated DM and CM reactor are also presented.},

Fully reduced on-state resistance in a new normally-off GaN transistor called Gate Injection Transistor (GIT) greatly helps to increase the efficiency. In addition, use of the bidirectional operation of the lateral and compact GITs with synchronous gate driving, the inverter is operated free from fly-wheel diodes which have been connected in parallel with IGBTs in a conventional inverter system.},

The results show that interleaving has the potential benefit to reduce ac passive components. To maximize such a benefit, the interleaving angle should be optimized according to the system requirements, including total harmonic distortion limit, ripple limit, or EMI standards, while considering operating conditions, such as modulation index and PWM schemes.

abstract = {This paper describes the design and control of an integrated direct-drive joint suitable for applications that require a high-precision motion control system. The joint integrates a direct-drive synchronous motor with axial air gap, a torque sensor, and a high-resolution position sensor. The key design aspects of the integrated joint, like the motor's armature, cooling system, motor housing, bearing arrangement, sensors, and power electronics are detailed. We also present a number of advanced implementations in motor torque control, optimal joint torque sensory feedback, and motion control using positive joint torque feedback. Experimental results illustrate an outstanding performance regarding thermal response, torque ripple, reference trajectory tracking, torque disturbance rejection, and joint stiffness.},

abstract = {This paper presents optimal control of a five-phase Integrated Modular Permanent Magnet Motor for normal and open-circuit fault conditions. Finite element analysis of the motor is carried out to obtain output torque of the motor. It is found that the output torque ripple of the machine when supplied with sinusoidal currents is considerably high. An optimum control technique is presented to operate the machine with minimum torque ripple and least stator ohmic loss. Furthermore, an optimum fault tolerant control method under open-circuit fault conditions is presented. Due to the half bridge and split capacitor configuration used for this modular motor drive the neutral voltage fluctuates considerably during the fault condition. To solve this problem, a constraint to make the summation of the phase currents to zero is incorporated in the derivation of the fault tolerant optimal control strategy. Optimal currents are calculated for normal and open-circuit fault-tolerant operation of the machine. Simulation results are presented for the verification of the control methods. Although the control techniques discussed in this work are applied for the five phase modular permanent magnet machine, they can be extended for multiphase permanent magnet machines with any number of phases.},

The energy stored in the dc-link capacitor is high and heavy iron chokes are needed in order to reduce the peak current through the rectifier diodes and to reduce the input current THD. New regulations to impose better interaction with the grid are expected to force the ASD manufacturers to add major changes to their products in order to improve the input current quality which may additionally provide other benefits such as regulated dc-link voltage and better immunity to unbalanced voltage supply. This paper investigates alternative three-phase ASD topologies for integrated motor drives by discussing the hardware requirements and comparing their performance, size of magnetics and also efficiency, which in this case is important in order to determine their cooling requirements.},

abstract = {A drive based on a matrix power converter for a 30 kW totally enclosed, fan cooled induction motor was developed to be fully integrated within the spatial envelope of the motor, located inside the end cover at the fan end of the machine. This paper describes the thermal design of the motor to dissipate the losses from the drive, which were approximately a third of those from the motor. The power electronic components were mounted on the inside of a new end cover which was equipped with an extensive array of fins cooled by air from the external fan. The electronic components were insulated from the air in the end region of the motor. A heat sink plate was installed within the motor behind the end cover to conduct the heat from the motor that would otherwise have been dissipated through the end cover. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to model the ventilation and heat transfer from the new end cover and to develop improved fan geometries. It was concluded that CFD can be used effectively to design motor cooling systems. An improved fan geometry was designed to keep the power electronics cool under high ambient temperatures with the motor running at full load},

The proposed IMMD topology reduces the segment voltage and offers an opportunity to utilize wide bandgap 200V GaN MOSFETs. Consequently, a reduction in IMMD size is achieved by eliminating inverter heat sink and optimizing the choice of DC-link capacitors. Gate signals of the IMMD segments are shifted (interleaved) to cancel the capacitor voltage ripple and further reduce the capacitor size. Motor winding configuration and coupling effect are also investigated to match with the IMMD design. An actively controlled balancing resistor is programmed to balance the voltages of series connected IMMD segments. Furthermore, this paper presents simulation results as well as experiment results to validate the proposed design.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {The standard voltage source inverter (VSI), widely used in electric vehicle/hybrid electric vehicle (EV/HEV) traction drives, requires a bulky dc bus capacitor to absorb the large switching ripple currents and prevent them from shortening the battery's life. The dc bus capacitor presents a significant barrier to meeting inverter cost, volume, and weight requirements for mass production of affordable EVs/HEVs. The large ripple currents become even more problematic for the film capacitors (the capacitor technology of choice for EVs/HEVs) in high temperature environments as their ripple current handling capability decreases rapidly with rising temperatures. It is shown in previous work that segmenting the VSI based traction drive system can significantly decrease the ripple currents and thus the size of the dc bus capacitor. This paper presents an integrated packaging scheme to reduce the system cost of a segmented traction drive.},

abstract = {The integration of an electrical machine and power electronics promises many benefits, the largest being an increase in power density. The use of system integration may lead to an increase in loss density and local or component temperatures. For this reason much attention needs to be paid to the thermal design aspects of the system. In the aerospace industry weight and reliability are of significant importance. In this paper the integration of a permanent magnet machine and power electronics into a single structure with joint thermal management is investigated. An overall goal of 2 kW/kg is set for system power density. Additionally in this paper fault tolerance is introduced into the design. This will allow the system to continue functioning should a single electrical fault occur. Principle faults are identified and discussed. A 50 kW, 6 phase, 8 pole permanent magnet machine is presented with a rotor speed of 50 krpm. A symmetrical phase shifted full bridge is used to drive the permanent magnet machine, aiding the functionality of fault tolerance and enabling the use of soft switching. A mathematical model for both machine and power electronics is created and used to calculate phase currents and losses in the machine and power electronics. Finally, spatial integration and thermal management concepts are presented and analysed.},
