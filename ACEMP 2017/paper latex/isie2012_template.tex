%\boldmath
In this paper, a novel method to eliminate the harmonic component occurring on the DC bus which is six times the grid frequency is proposed. This harmonic component is present due to natural commutation of the passive diode bridge rectifier in motor drive applications. In conventional drives, bulky LC filters are utilized to reduce the effect of this harmonic component to the motor drive inverter. With this method, DC bus capacitance requirement can be minimized which will enhance the power density and decrease the cost of the overall system. Third harmonic injection is used with modular inverters in an integrated modular motor drive application. Both rectifier and inverter side analytical models are presented, the elimination of the sixth harmonic component is described analytically, and verified by simulations performed on MATLAB/Simulink. The possible adverse effects of third harmonic injection method are also discussed.

Most studies consider only one side for DC link characterisation or filter component optimization, although they should be considered simultaneously. This research aims at modeling the system as a whole, investigating the effect of harmonic components injected to the DC link from both sides and eliminating the low frequency harmonic due to the rectifier side by using the modular structure of the inverter side.

\section{Problem definition}
%analytical Rectifier model, 6th harmonic component %injection, LC filter characteristics

A conventional motor drive system block diagram is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:conv_motor_drive}. The rectifier and inverter are connected via the DC link, therefore a harmonic component injected from one side may be reflected to the other side, disrupting its operation. For systems having two active converters on both sides such as back-to-back converters, the only fluctuations seen on the DC link voltage are high frequency components which are directly related to the switching frequencies of each side. On the other hand, in case of passive converters such as diode bridge rectifiers, low frequency components emerge on the DC link voltage which are related to the grid supply frequency. Since grid frequency is usually much smaller than the switching frequencies applied to active converters, filtering of fluctuations on the DC link requires much larger and more expensive filter components in case of passive rectifiers.

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/conv_motor_drive}
  \caption{A conventional motor drive system block diagram}
  \label{fig:conv_motor_drive}
\end{figure}

The diode bridge rectifier is a natural-commutated converter, circuit schematic of which is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:rect_circuit}. A second order LC filter which is of low-pass type is usually utilized at the rectifier output for filtering. In this section, the harmonic content of the rectifier output voltage and the effect of filtering are shown analytically.

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/rect_circuit}
  \caption{Diode bridge rectifier circuit diagram}
  \label{fig:rect_circuit}
\end{figure}

The supply voltages are shown in \ref{eq:1}-\ref{eq:3}, where $V_m$ is the RMS value of the supply voltage and $f_s$ is the supply frequency. With this configuration, integer multiples of the harmonic component frequency of which is six times the grid frequency $f_s$ are present on the rectifier output voltage in addition to the DC component as shown in \ref{eq:4}. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
v_{sa}(t) = \sqrt{2}V_msin(2\pi f_s t)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
v_{sb}(t) = \sqrt{2}V_msin(2\pi f_s t-2\pi/3)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3}
v_{sc}(t) = \sqrt{2}V_msin(2\pi f_s t-4\pi/3)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:4}
v_{dc}(t) = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{\pi} \bigg[1-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{36k^2-1}cos(6k\omega_{0}t)\bigg] 
%\sqrt{2}V_msin(2\pi f_s t)
\end{equation}

The transfer function between $v_load$ and $v_dc$ is obtained to show the characteristics of the filter as in \ref{eq:5}. Magnitude and phase of the harmonic components that are of interest are obtained from this model and they are later used in the implementation of the proposed method.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:5}
H(jw) = \frac{v_{L}(jw)}{v_{dc}(jw)} = \frac{R_{L}}{R_{L}(1-w^2L_{dc}C_{dc})+jwL_{dc}}
\end{equation}

A simulation is performed for the verification of these analytical models on MATLAB/Simulink, for 400V line-to-line grid voltage at 50 Hz, filter inductance of 1 mH, filter capacitance of 4 mF and load resistance of 10 $\Omega$. In Fig. \ref{fig:rect_wave2}, the three-phase input voltages, the rectifier output voltage and the filtered load voltage waveforms are shown. In Fig. \ref{fig:rect_harm1} and \ref{fig:rect_harm2}, the harmonic spectra of rectifier output voltage and load voltage are shown, respectively.

\end{figure}

A load voltage peak-to-peak ripple of 1\% is usually aimed in case of motor drive inverter applications and the filter values are adjusted here such that a ripple of \textbf{X}\% is obtained. The inductance value is usually determined by the current ripple on this inductor and it has minor effect on the load voltage ripple. Capacitance values on the DC link are usually in a few hundred microfarad range when only high frequency fluctuations are considered, however in this case, capacitance values in milifarad range are needed.

In IMMD applications, decreasing the volume of the passive elements is a major challenge due to having small volume. Therefore, integration of the motor drive with passive rectifiers to the motor is a problem.

\section{Description of the proposed method}
In the proposed method, a harmonic component which is six times the grid frequency is aimed to be created at the inverter DC input such that there will be no low order harmonic current flowing through the DC link capacitor. By doing so, the DC link capacitance requirement can be reduced significantly.

The harmonic component is created by injecting zero sequence third harmonic components at the motor side. Voltages and current expressions of one inverter module with zero sequence third harmonic injection are shown in \ref{eq:1}-\ref{eq:6}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
v_a(t) = V_1sin(2\pi ft-\phi_{1v})+V_3sin(6\pi ft-\phi_{3v})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
v_b(t) = V_1sin(2\pi ft-2\pi/3-\phi_{1v})+V_3sin(6\pi ft-\phi_{3v})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3}
v_c(t) = V_1sin(2\pi ft-4\pi/3-\phi_{1v})+V_3sin(6\pi ft-\phi_{3v})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:4}
i_a(t) = I_1sin(2\pi ft-\phi_{1i})+I_3sin(6\pi ft-\phi_{3i})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:5}
i_b(t) = I_1sin(2\pi ft-2\pi/3-\phi_{1i})+I_3sin(6\pi ft-\phi_{3i})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:6}
i_c(t) = I_1sin(2\pi ft-4\pi/3-\phi_{1i})+I_3sin(6\pi ft-\phi_{3i})
\end{equation}

Let us make the definitions shown in \ref{eq:7}-\ref{eq:14}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:7}
\phi_{11p} = \phi_{1v}+\phi_{1i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:8}
\phi_{33p} = \phi_{3v}+\phi_{3i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:9}
\phi_{13p} = \phi_{1v}+\phi_{3i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:10}
\phi_{31p} = \phi_{3v}+\phi_{1i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:11}
\phi_{11n} = \phi_{1v}-\phi_{1i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:12}
\phi_{33n} = \phi_{3v}-\phi_{3i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:13}
\phi_{13n} = \phi_{1v}-\phi_{3i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:14}
\phi_{31n} = \phi_{3v}-\phi_{1i}
\end{equation}

The instantaneous power expression for each phase are shown in \ref{eq:15}-\ref{eq:17}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:15}
\begin{multlined}
p_a(t) = 
\frac{V_1I_1}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(\phi_{11n})-cos(4\pi ft-\phi_{11p}) \bigg \rbrack
\\
+
\frac{V_1I_3}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(4\pi ft+\phi_{13n})-cos(8\pi ft-\phi_{13p}) \bigg \rbrack
\\
+
\frac{V_3I_1}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(4\pi ft-\phi_{31n})-cos(8\pi ft-\phi_{31p}) \bigg \rbrack
\\
+
\frac{V_3I_3}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(\phi_{33n})-cos(12\pi ft-\phi_{33p}) \bigg \rbrack,
\end{multlined}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:16}
\begin{multlined}
p_b(t) = 
\frac{V_1I_1}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(\phi_{11n})-cos(4\pi ft-4\pi/3-\phi_{11p}) \bigg \rbrack
\\
+
\frac{V_1I_3}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(4\pi ft+ 2\pi/3+\phi_{13n})-cos(8\pi ft-2\pi/3-\phi_{13p}) \bigg \rbrack
\\
+
\frac{V_3I_1}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(4\pi ft+2\pi/3-\phi_{31n})-cos(8\pi ft-2\pi/3-\phi_{31p}) \bigg \rbrack
\\
+
\frac{V_3I_3}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(\phi_{33n})-cos(12\pi ft-\phi_{33p}) \bigg \rbrack,
\end{multlined}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:17}
\begin{multlined}
p_c(t) = 
\frac{V_1I_1}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(\phi_{11n})-cos(4\pi ft-8\pi/3-\phi_{11p}) \bigg \rbrack
\\
+
\frac{V_1I_3}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(4\pi ft+ 4\pi/3+\phi_{13n})-cos(8\pi ft-4\pi/3-\phi_{13p}) \bigg \rbrack
\\
+
\frac{V_3I_1}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(4\pi ft+4\pi/3-\phi_{31n})-cos(8\pi ft-4\pi/3-\phi_{31p}) \bigg \rbrack
\\
+
\frac{V_3I_3}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(\phi_{33n})-cos(12\pi ft-\phi_{33p}) \bigg \rbrack,
\end{multlined}
\end{equation}

The total instantaneous power becomes as in \ref{eq:18}. As seen, all the frequency components which are two times and four times the fundamental frequency are cancelled, leaving two DC components and a component at six times the fundamental frequency. The last term will be used in this method for the cancellation of the sixth harmonic injected by the rectifier.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:18}
\begin{multlined}
p_{total}(t) = 
\frac{V_1I_1}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(\phi_{11n}) \bigg \rbrack
+
\frac{V_3I_3}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(\phi_{33n}) \bigg \rbrack
\\
+
\frac{V_3I_3}{2} \bigg \lbrack cos(12\pi ft-\phi_{33p}) \bigg \rbrack
\end{multlined}
\end{equation}


\section{Implementation of the method and practical issues}

This method is proposed for IMMD applications where selection of  number of inverter modules, number of stator phases etc. are flexible. This makes the application of the method more convenient. In this paper, a six pole machine is considered. The schematic of the segmented stator and modular inverters is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:rect_circuit}. 

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/rect_circuit}
  \caption{IMMD scheme}
  \label{fig:rect_circuit}
\end{figure}

It has been shown that, with conventional three-phase connection, injection of third harmonic is impossible, regardless of the winding connection being delta or wye, due to the nature of the three-phase. Therefore, in this paper, an IMMD scheme is proposed such that each stator coil is fed by a separate single-phase bridge inverter.

The conventional connection and the proposed connection are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:rect_circuit}.

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/rect_circuit}
  \caption{Conventional connection and proposed connection}
  \label{fig:rect_circuit}
\end{figure}

The drawbacks of such a connection are as follows: bunlarÄ± aÃ§Ä±kla

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Increased number of switches: cost, aÃ§Ä±kla
  \item Conduction loss, switching loss
  \item Copper loss, core loss
  \item Torque ripple
\end{enumerate}

Additional advantages: bunlarÄ± aÃ§Ä±kla
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Increased modularity
  \item Conduction loss, switching loss
\end{enumerate}

Number of series and parallel connected modules
Give the inductance capacitance, motor parameters etc.

1. The rectifier output current, the inverter input current, and DC link capacitor current at the same figure

5. Discuss the variable frequency case

6. Discuss the capacitor requirement
There is no effect on the capacitance, but the RMS current rating decreases
This will have no effect on film capacitors unless switching frequency is higher than 150 kHz
But, the requirement on the RMS current will decrease significantly so that aluminium electrolytic capacitors can be made smaller now
This will have the effects of:
- Lower cost
- Higher power density
- Lifetime may be extended
