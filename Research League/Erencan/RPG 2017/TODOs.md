## Literature
* Technical background of reactive power injection via photovoltaic inverters **Erencan**
* Similar work on this idea (eliminating reactive power compensation unit, RPCU) **Mesut**

## Research
* Static VAr compensators (STATCOMs), methodology, operating principles **Erencan**
* Inverter installation costs **Erencan**
* RPCU installation cost **Erencan**
* Discrete operation of RPCUs  **Erencan**
* Limitations via regulations on reactive power, or power factor **Erencan**
* How commonly are capacitive loads used?  **Erencan**
* Inverter datasheets, critical parameters  **Erencan**

## Analysis
* Power system modeling and simulation platform **Mesut**
  * Inverter simulation
  * RPCU
  * Demand side variations (loads)
* Long term financial loss due to inverter and RPCU losses  **Mesut**
  * Loss characterisation
  * Tariff estimation
* Capacitor size requirement (possible change) **Mesut**
* LCL filter size requirement **???**
* Effect of discrete operation of RPCUs on cost due to limitations (penalty)
* Comparison of very low active power injection case (power factor getting very poor)

## Result
* Cost vs years
* Cost vs reactive power demand (at which region the proposed method is feasible)
* Cost vs capacitive operation (how capacitive the load should be for the method to be feasible)
* Something about AyaslÄ± Research Center


## Comments:
* Do we apply cost analysis considering commercially available components; i.e., inverters, or design the inverter on our own?
