## Literature
* Technical background of reactive power injection via photovoltaic inverters
* Similar work on this idea (eliminating reactive power compensation unit, RPCU)

## Research
* Static VAr compensators (STATCOMs), methodology, operating principles
* Inverter installation costs
* RPCU installation cost
* Inverter maintenance requirement **???**
* RPCU maintenance requirement
* Discrete operation of RPCUs
* Limitations via regulations on reactive power, or power factor
* How commonly are capacitive loads used?
* Inverter datasheets, critical parameters

## Analysis
* Long term financial loss due to inverter and RPCU losses
  * Loss characterisation
  * Tariff estimation
* Capacitor size requirement (possible change)
* LCL filter size requirement **???**
* Effect of discrete operation of RPCUs on cost due to limitations (penalty)
* Comparison of very low active power injection case (power factor getting very poor)
* Effect of maintenance requirements on long term financial loss

## Result
* Cost vs years
* Cost vs reactive power demand (at which region the proposed method is feasible)
* Cost vs capacitive operation (how capacitive the load should be for the method to be feasible)
* Something about AyaslÄ± Research Center


## Comments:
* Do we apply cost analysis considering commercially available components; i.e., inverters, or design the inverter on our own?
