> Background: For physical reasons, feeding in active power will lead to a voltage increase, especially in the low-voltage grid, which might become a problem (see Fig. 3). At the same time, a large amount of reactive power is necessary here to lower the voltage again.

**Question:** When the unity power factor is reached, the voltage drop will be decreased. If the voltage is increased, the photovoltaic system might disconnect from grid??? In such a case, again reactive power injection might be necessary to maintain the grid connection. Is this an advantage of using a inverter compensation or DEcompensation?   

> SMA is already offering a range of reactive-power-compatible products: all newer central inverters, the Sunny Mini Central inverters with reactive power control, and the new Sunny Tripower are all designed for producing reactive power. The current central inverters of the HE series already meet all requirements of the Medium Voltage Guidelines, which will become effective in mid-2010, and offer shift factors of up to 0.90; the other devices even offer factors of up to 0.80.  

**0.9 pf gives 21.8 kVAr for 50kVA system. 0.8 pf gives 30 kVAr for the same power rating.**

> Power Reducer Box – the all-rounder
The SMA Power Reducer Box is an additional communication solution for presetting the shift factor: in addition to remote-controlling the feed-in power, the device also lets you remote-select from up to 16 freely definable shift factors or reactive power values (the maximum values of the used inverters are to be considered here).

 CP XT, CP-JP and CP-US series of **SMA** but in high power ratings up to 1MW!  
The "Q at Night" option provides an additional solution: the inverters of the CP XT, CP-JP and CP-US series can
also provide **compensating reactive power at night,** feeding pure reactive power into the utility grid.
