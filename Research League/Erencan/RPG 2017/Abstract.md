## Utilization of grid-connected photovoltaic inverters for reactive power compensation in low voltage systems

* 3-5 tane makale bulunacak. Bunlara atıf yapılacak, biz üstüne ne koyuyoruz bu vurgulanacak.
* Capacitor analizini abstract'a koyalım
* Gece normalde çalışmazken şimdi çalışacak. Ekstra loss katacak.
* Static reactive power compensation units such as STATCOMs are widely used in medium voltage distribution level and high voltage transmission level systems. However, their utilization in low voltage systems is not common due to its costs. In this paper, ststic compensation in low voltage applications is proposed and it is believed that it is more feasible then reactive power compensation units which are mechanically controlled.
* Zero injection durumunda da çalışacak, bu bir avantaj. Yani active power olmasa bile power factor'ü her türlü unity yapabilecek.

Abtrsact kurgusu:
* Şu an reactive power compensation unit'ler kullanılıyor. Bunları sıkıntıları var (açıkla). Şöyle case'ler gördük (Ayaslı örneği)
* Bunun yerine PV sistemin "static" olarak reactive power compensation yapmasını propose ediyoruz.
* Bu tabi modifikasyonlşar gerektiriyor. Sisteme additional short ve long term cost'lar katıyor.
* Bunun için iki durumu karşılaştıran cost analizi yapıcaz.


**Abstract:** Penetration of the renewable sources are increasing each passing day. Advances in the technology increases this penetration further. Photovoltaic systems especially are observed in the offices, medium scale residential buildings. The high amount of renewable sources and their expected increase in the near future bring some auxiliary services as voltage and frequency support. They can also be used for reactive power generation in places where reactive power compensation is obligatory. In other words, the inverters existing in the panels can be used for capacitive reactive power generation in order to compensate the reactive power demand in their loads. However, it is obvious that this replacement of conventional reactive power compensation units with oversized inverters needs special investigation in terms of cost and performance.  

In this study, it is proposed that conventional old reactive power compensation units can be eliminated in the system thanks to the inverters' wide variety power factor capability. This can be done by making use of capacitive operation of the inverters with keeping the active power output maximum. Therefore, an over sizing inverter is necessary in order to keep active power maximum. Over sizing the inverter would bring some disadvantages in terms of long term costs (higher conduction losses) and one time costs (oversized inverter). However, it is also obvious that compensation units are one time cost as themselves and they also have internal losses. Moreover, they operate in a discrete way in contrast the inverters wide range of power generation capacity. Finally, the maintenance costs should be investigated depending on the maintenance frequency.

Finally, these investigation will be applied to a case study. Ayaslı Research Center, which is located in Middle East Technical University, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, with PV units (50 KWp) and reactive power compensation unit (50 kVAr) will be the case where the costs will be calculated. By making use of these investigations, one time costs and long term costs will be compared in order to reach the optimized choice. It is expected that bulky compensation unit cost would be higher for some years. Depending on the time that their costs will be equal, optimal choice for the case study will be evaluated.  Finally, depending on the reactive power demand, selection between a reactive power compensation unit or an oversized inverter will be assessed.
