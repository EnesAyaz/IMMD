# Power Fluctuation
## Single-phase system
![](./images/dclink/Singlephase.png)
* First part is time invarient real power
* Second part is time-varying fluctuating power
* Frequency is twice the fundamental
* Capacitors must be large

## Three-phase system
![](./images/dclink/Threephase.png)
* Instantaneous power is equal to real power
* No fluctuating power
* Reactive power of each phase is balanced by the other two phases
* Capacitors are small (only ripple frequency at kHz level)
