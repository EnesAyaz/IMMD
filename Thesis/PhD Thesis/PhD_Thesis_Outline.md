### Chapter 2: Integrated Modular Motor Drives - State of the Art
#### 2.1. IMMD Concept
The following will be covered in detail: Integration, modularization, what is IMMD, Advantages, Challenges, Research Opportunities, Possible applications

#### 2.2. Wide Band Gap Power Semiconductor Devices
Existing Devices and Their Properties are shortly covered. GaN is explained more in detail. Relation of using WBG PSD (especially GaN) with IMMD is explained. Example prototypes that used WBG are mentioned.

#### 2.3. Motor Drive Topologies
Conventional mkotor drive topologies are shown (VSI-CSI, 2L-3L). Motor drive topologies suitable for IMMD are introduced and their operating principles are explained. A classification is given (single-input, multiple-input etc.). The focus is on series and parallel connection, their motivation and advantages. Their advantages and disadvantages are told (comparison). The comparison categories are: component quantity, sizing, extra requirements, degree of modularity (redundancy), stress on devices and windings etc.

#### 2.4. Machine Configurations
The machine types suitable for IMMD are introduced with reasoning and referencing to the previous work. The segmentation of the motor (split winding) and its methods (types) are given from previous work. The focus will be on PMSM. Winding configurations are explained more in detail.

#### 2.5. Fault Tolerance Concept
The definition is given and the concept of fault tolerance is explained by also mentioning reliability and redundancy concepts (and their relations with each other). The fault tolerant motor drive examples from previous work are explained. The relation of fault tolerance with IMMD and this thesis is explained in detail.

#### 2.6. Passive Components
Passive components in motor drives. The motivation behind minimizing them. DC Link capacitor types. Selection methods, parameters. Relation with IMMD (interleaving concept). Motivation behind using AC filters (GaN fast switching, motor insulation etc). Types of filters used previously. Selection methods, parameters.

#### 2.7. Previous IMMD's
A list of IMD examples are provided with different kinds of classifications. Pictures are provided. Modular ones (IMMD) are mentioned separately. This section is more like "who made what kind of IMMD for which reason". A chronological order is preferred for being able to see the development of IMMD technology. Their applications are also mentioned.
