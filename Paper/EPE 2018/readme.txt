Synopsis Guidelines

The synopses should consist of:

    a 3 to maximum 5 pages anonymous summary, including an abstract with no more than 50 words. The topic number(s) and your indication of preference for dialogue or lecture presentation must be clearly mentioned.
(Be aware that, if your paper proposal is accepted, it will be the International Scientific Committee who decides upon dialogue or lecture presentation);
    key diagrams;
    a references list.

The originality and the main technical improvements proposed in your paper must be clearly indicated.

If the submitted abstract and summary do not meet the requirements detailed on this page, they may not be considered for selection.

The synopses will be submitted over the internet, using the conference host website. A link to the website will be available in due course from the bottom of this page as well as from http://www.epe-association.org. The site will be open for upload from 16 October 2017 onwards.

Authors of papers provisionally selected for presentation will receive a notification, and will be able to download the instructions for preparing full/final papers as well as dialogue and/or lecture presentations from this website. The final programme will be based on a review of the full papers.

A selection of outstanding conference papers will be published in the EPE Journal, which is an ISI registered journal, afterwards. Authors may also propose their papers for publication in the IEEE-PELS transactions. The papers will also be registered in IEEE Xplore. All presented papers will be listed in the Web of Science (formerly Web of Knowledge), INSPEC database for Engineering. Selected papers published in the EPE Journal will be automatically included in the Web of Science – Core Collection and get a WOS-Accession number. The Organizing Committee works toward ensuring that all conference papers are listed in the Core Collection as well. It is already the case for the 2014 and 2015 editions.

Instructions for Electronic File Formats

Your efforts to follow the guidelines are essential in ensuring the proper working of the reviewing procedure. These guidelines guarantee the quality of the conference.

Below, you will find guidelines for file and graphics format. A help desk, contactable by email, will be made available in due course.

For your information, your file will be checked for compatibility problems and then put at the disposal of the Topic Chairperson, Co-Chairperson and Reviewers for evaluation.  They will download your file or receive it by e-mail.

All operations require that the original file is compliant with the general guidelines.
Please be careful if you work in a country using special fonts/characters: double byte fonts (Asian countries), east European fonts etc. The help desk will help you by e-mail to solve these problems, if necessary.

Paper headings
The synopsis will be headed by the paper title.  The origin (University (U), Industry (I), University in collaboration with Industry (UI) or Industry in collaboration with University (IU)) will be indicated on the second line,
next to the chosen topics and sub-topics 1 and 2.

THE SYNOPSIS MUST BE STRICTLY ANONYMOUS.  NO INDICATION OF THE AUTHOR(S) MAY APPEAR ON THE DOCUMENT. (No address, company name or the alike).

File size
The papers must be 3 to maximum 5 A4 pages and the file size (in .pdf format) should not exceed 3 Mb.

File Format
Papers should be saved in .pdf format.

Fonts
Paper Title: Times New Roman 12 pt bold
Headings: Times New Roman 10 pt bold

Graphics
All graphics must be inserted in the .pdf document. Available file formats are: WMF, EPS, TIFF, PICT, BMP, JPG and GIF. Graphics, pictures and other non-text elements could increase unnecessarily the file size. To avoid this, graphics must be prepared at the right size and color depth before including them into the final document. Avoid cropping or other distortion to ensure a good printed quality of your document.
The use of JPG or GIF format is the best solution to decrease the total file size of your document.
