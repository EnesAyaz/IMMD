Reviewer 2:
You mentioned at least twice the synchronous rectification mode, i.e. turn the device actively on during reverse freewheeling operation, as a problem. Of course, synchronous rectification is not possible during dead time to avoid shot-through and the higher on-state voltage causes additional losses during that time. But is that so dramatic? Maybe the respective passages in your text are just misleading.

Reviewer 3:
I recommend to include a comparison of the forward and reverse I(V) characteristics at high temperatures to show the accuracy of the model.
The inclusión of experimental results in the final paper is needed.

Reviewer 4:
Dear authors,
thank you for your contribution.

- Your presentation of the channel current is really interesting, but the simulation results need to be analyzed in more detail, e.g. including parameter variations, an analysis of the gate-voltage, and the effect of cross conduction.
-  Since you investigate internal quantities by simulation, how will you be able to verify this with the announced experimental results?
- Could you please comment on the deviation of your reverse conducting model results from the datasheet values?
- In the final paper, you should describe the model more precisely, e.g. how was the curve fitting for the capacitances derived, and what do the parameters K describe in eq, 1 and 2?
- Also, I think your explanation concerning soft switching on p.3 is not accurate.
- Your explanation of the dead time effects in the last section is not new.
