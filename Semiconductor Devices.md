* For normal Si semiconductor, the operating temperature cannot be high because of the significant leakage current
* The higher critical field will allow a higher breakdown voltage for identical epitaxial thickness.
* The SiC and GaN devices can reach very low resistance.
* Since GaN have largest electron mobility, it should ultimately be the best material for high frequency operation
* The thermal conductivity of SiC is better than Si and GaN.
* BFoM: Baligaâ€˜s figure of merit: a measure of the on-resistance of a unipolar device. Higher value means a lower Ron.

# Existing WBG devices

* SiC schottky diode: The SiC schottky diodes with rating voltage up to 1.7 kV are available. The operating temperature can e as high as 200 C.

* SiC FET: Rating voltage up to 1.7 kV are available. CoolMOS (Si technology) may compare, but their ratings are up to 900V. Have very low Ron.

* GaN FET: Use of Si substrate is more suitable for commercial products (due to cost). Depletion mode GaNs are normally-on (not desirable). Enhancement mode are normall-off. Cascode solution can be used as shown below:

* WBG IGBT: IGBT is bipolar where MOSFET is unipolar, thus IGBTs have smaller Ron. But, IGBT has on-state voltage drop.
