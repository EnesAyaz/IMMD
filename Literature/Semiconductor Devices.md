* For normal Si semiconductor, the operating temperature cannot be high because of the significant leakage current
* The higher critical field will allow a higher breakdown voltage for identical epitaxial thickness.
* The SiC and GaN devices can reach very low resistance.
* Since GaN have largest electron mobility, it should ultimately be the best material for high frequency operation
* The thermal conductivity of SiC is better than Si and GaN.
* BFoM: Baligaâ€˜s figure of merit: a measure of the on-resistance of a unipolar device. Higher value means a lower Ron.

# Existing WBG devices

* SiC schottky diode: The SiC schottky diodes with rating voltage up to 1.7 kV are available. The operating temperature can e as high as 200 C.

* SiC FET: Rating voltage up to 1.7 kV are available. CoolMOS (Si technology) may compare, but their ratings are up to 900V. Have very low Ron.

* GaN FET: Use of Si substrate is more suitable for commercial products (due to cost). Depletion mode GaNs are normally-on (not desirable). Enhancement mode are normall-off. Cascode solution can be used as shown below:

* WBG IGBT: IGBT is bipolar where MOSFET is unipolar, thus IGBTs have smaller Ron. But, IGBT has on-state voltage drop.

## Comments on comparison:
* Similar Rds-on: Similar conduction Loss
* GaN has lowest capacitances: Lower switching loss
* SiC is better than Si in capacitances (switching loss)
* Negligible gate driver loss
* GaN has no reverse recovery. Only conduction loss in diode (very low)
* SiC has better diode loss than Si

* Zero Qr: No recovery loss. Very low loss during dead time.

# Practical Considerations for GaN
## Parasitic Inductance
* GaN has very small package Inductance.
* As GaNs are intended to be switched at high frequencies, PCB inductance minimization is very important.
* Minimizing inductance while designing circular shape PCBs, maintaining thermal performance and high voltage clearance is difficult.
* Parasitic inductance in both gate driver and power stage will affect switching loss and voltage overshoot.
* Loops in the PCB:
![](./images/device/loops.png)
* One should consider gate driver loop, power stage loop and also the coupling between them.
## Gate resistance
* Gate-turn on must be made slower to avoid short-circuit and switching time control.
* It also helps for the damping of resonance between parasitic inductance and gate capacitance. The resonance may cause gate voltage breakdown.
* It will decide the amount of overshoot and dv/dt in the power loop.
* Higher gate resistance will yield higher switching loss since the switching time is increased.
