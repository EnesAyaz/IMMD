In conventional motor drive systems, drive units and motors are designed as two different modules which brings increased volume and weight to the system. This causes limitations in applications such as electric traction, aerospace and space where power density is critical. Moreover, Electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems emerge due to the connection cables. The IMMD concept proposes that the motor drive unit can be integrated directly to the motor back-end such that, power density of the overall system can be enhanced significantly as well as cost can be reduced. Modularization of the system suggests that the whole system can be divided into several parts, which increases the fault tolerance (i.e. the system can continue to work with reduced power rating in case of failures). Furthermore, voltage stress on both power electronics and motor windings can be reduced and the heat dissipation can be distributed across multiple modules.

Apart from these advantages, integration of the motor and the drive brings some challenges. All the drive components including power semiconductor devices, passive elements, control electronics and heat sink should fit into a much smaller volume. Moreover, the power electronics and control electronics are directly subjected to vibration and high temperature due to its close position to the motor. These challenges can be addressed by the utilization of wide band-gap power semiconductor devices such as SiC or GaN with their high switching frequencies. Increasing the frequency reduces the size of passive elements and enhance the system efficiency. In addition, interleaving techniques can be effectively used, which can further reduce the size of the passive components by decreasing voltage and current ripples.

DC link capacitor banks usually constitute the largest volume of motor drive systems. Therefore, selection of optimum DC link capacitor is also critical in IMMD designs in the sense of power density, circuit height, temperature rise, lifetime and cost. For optimum capacitor selection, analytical modeling of the DC link has been achieved considering DC link ripple voltage, DC link RMS ripple current and temperature rise. Commercially available off-the-shelf DC link capacitors with different properties are considered including capacitor type, capacitance DC voltage rating, ripple current rating, lifetime, volume and height. An algorithm has been developed for the selection of optimum DC link capacitor bank with different combinations of series and parallel connections of various capacitors having different ratings.

An IMMD prototype design has been performed with a 7 kW permanent magnet brushless direct current (PM-BLDC) motor having fractional slot structure. The stator is divided into four identical parts each having three-phase to obtain the modular structure. A dedicated motor drive and control PCB is developed for each module. The modules are connected with two-series/two-parallel structure on the DC link. 600V 20A GaN transistors are used. A central processor unit is used with master/slave logic to synchronize the drive signals of each module according to a position sensor.
