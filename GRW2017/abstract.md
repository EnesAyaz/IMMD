In this research work, a new concept called Integrated Modular Motor Drive (IMMD) is presented. A review of IMMD technologies is given and current research and future prospects are studied. In conventional motor drive systems, drive units are placed at a separate cabinet and connected to the motor with long cables bringing increased volume and weight to the system. This causes limitations in applications such as electric traction, aerospace and space where power density is critical. Moreover, Electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems emerge due to the connection cables which can cause high voltage transients contributing to the aging of motor winding insulations. The IMMD concept proposes that the motor drive unit can be integrated directly to the motor back-end such that, power density of the overall system can be enhanced significantly as well as cost can be reduced since separate panels or cables are eliminated. Modularization of the system suggests that the whole system can be divided into several parts. The main motivation behind this modular structure is increasing the fault tolerance of the system such that operation can continue with reduced power rating in case of one or more parts fail. Furthermore, voltage stress on both power electronics and motor windings can be reduced and the heat dissipation can be distributed.
Apart from these advantages, integration of the motor and the drive brings some challenges. All the drive components including power semiconductor devices, passive elements, control electronics and heat sink should be fit to a much smaller volume, which needs volume reduction in components. Moreover, the power electronics and control electronics are directly subjected to a vibratinal and high tempereture environment. These challenges can be addressed by the utilization of wide band-gap power semiconductor devices such as SiC or GaN drive frequency of which can be high while keeping the efficiency in acceptable regions. Increasing the frequency yields size reduction of passive elements and enhancing the system efficiency decreases the heat sink requirement. In addition, interleaving technique can be effectively used since the system is modular, which can further minimize the passive components by decreasing the voltage and current ripples.
Use of such semiconductor devices brings additional problems related toparasitic components on both power stage and gate drive.
